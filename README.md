# Images as Plane Objects for NL2
A simple, quick but effective solution using only Windows Batch files to place images as planes in NoLimits 2 Roller Coaster Simulation: [https://www.nolimitscoaster.com/](https://www.nolimitscoaster.com/)

## How to use
Simply drag and drop an image on one of these Windows batch files to let it create some simple plane model file with additonal files for usage inside of NL2, after that place the object in the Editor.

Don't hestitate to make fine adjustments to the created NL2SCO and NL2MAT files for your final needs after that.

You will also find three demonstration images and some some quick instruction video inside the sub folder when you download the zip file using the releases feature of github.

### Note
that newer Windows versions may probably warn you that these batch files are potentially harmful, they are indeed *potentially* like any executable from unknown sources!

If you are in doubt

- It might be some good advise to always do a quick cross check that files you downloaded from the internet are indeed containing what they should in any case before executing them -

just copy the code directly from the repository after having convinced that there's just `echo` commands inside them and save the text file as a `.bat` file, I recommend to also give them some meaningful name then in this case.
